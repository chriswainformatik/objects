# Objects!
## A simple object oriented language for creating graphical objects

This is supposed to be an educational application students can use to practice object oriented style commands.

Class and method names are German.

Planned commands are:
 - `objectName:CLASSNAME` to create an object with a given name from a given class
 - `objectName.methodName(...)` to call methods provided by objects
  
Available lasses are:
 - `RECHTECK`
 - `DREIECK`
 - `KREIS`

### TODO:
 - fix tooltips
 - run the code
   - create shapes (âœ…)
   - prevent duplicate shape names
   - edit shapes by method calls
