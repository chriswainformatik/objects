# Objects!
## A simple object oriented language for creating graphical objects

[See live demo here](https://chriswainformatik.github.io/objects/)

This is an educational application that students can use to practice object oriented style commands. Class and method names are in German.

Available commands are:
 - `objectName:CLASSNAME` to create an object with a given name from a given class
 - `objectName.methodName(...)` to call methods provided by objects
  
Available objects and methods: See help section of the app.

The settings can be saved to the web storage of your browser.
