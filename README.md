# Objects!
## A simple object oriented language for creating graphical objects

[See live demo here](https://chriswainformatik.github.io/objects/)

This is supposed to be an educational application students can use to practice object oriented style commands. Class and method names are German. See help sidebar for more info.

Available commands are:
 - `objectName:CLASSNAME` to create an object with a given name from a given class
 - `objectName.methodName(...)` to call methods provided by objects
  
Available classes are:
 - `RECHTECK`
 - `DREIECK`
 - `KREIS`

### TODO:
 - show created objects (as in BlueJ)
